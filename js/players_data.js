        "bio": "Initially trained in London with David Martin, Lorraine McAslan moved to New York at the age of seventeen on the recommendation of Isaac Stern to study with Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School. Since then, she has shared the concert platform with many of Britain's greatest orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and the English Chamber Orchestra, and has worked with conductors such as Andrew Davis, Raymond Leppard, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Libor Pešek, and Jukka-Pekka Saraste. Her European debut with the Bern Symphony Orchestra under Eliahu Inbal was broadcast live on Swiss Radio. Lorraine started her recording career with an acclaimed disc of the Elgar and Walton violin and piano sonatas for the ‘ASV Records’ label. Her recordings to date for ASV, Collins, Naxos, and Dutton include concertos by Mozart, Hoffmann, and sonatas by Beethoven, Debussy, Ravel, Saint-Saëns, Martinů, Janáček, Holst, Bridge, and Britten.<br><br>Her interest in neglected British composers has led her to record several discs for Dutton Epoch, including works by Arthur Benjamin, Kenneth Leighton, Sir Granville Bantock, Richard Arnell, Dorothy Howell, Benjamin Dale, and two discs featuring Rebecca Clarke. Her recording of violin concertos by Creith, Arnell, and Pitfield has received universal acclaim, with The Strad magazine praising, 'Lorraine McAslan plays these engaging rediscoveries with virtuoso passion and soaring intensity that is hugely compelling.' The BBC Music Magazine commented on her 2017 recording of the Walton and Bliss concerti, stating, 'McAslan’s contribution is state-of-the-art...her response to the solo part, composed for Heifetz, is as fine as her bombproof tuning and warm, not overly sumptuous, tone and expression.'<br><br>Lorraine has been the leader of the London Soloists Ensemble and also of the Maggini String Quartet, with whom she continued to champion British music. With them, she recorded the Sir Lennox Berkeley and William Alwyn quartets for Naxos.<br><br>Lorraine pursues a busy teaching career at the Royal Academy of Music Junior Department, and in 2007, she was elected an Honorary Associate of the Royal Academy of Music.",
